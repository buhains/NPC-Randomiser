# NPC Randomiser

This is a randomiser for Dungeon Masters to create quick NPCs on the fly. It can be easily tweaked to change the rate of appearance for certain attributes, as well as add new attributes into the mix. 

Randomised NPCs will be generated on run. Here's an example:
```
Gender: Male
Class: Warlock
Race: Gnome
Name: Kellen
Attitude: Excitable
```
